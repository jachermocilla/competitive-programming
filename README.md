# Competitive Programming

Writing CRUD apps can become boring in the long run..

This repo contains my submissions to some online programming contests.
After five failed submissions, I "cheat" by reading the editorial for a problem.
:)

BTW, I am also the self-proclaimed Team Manager of [UPLB Eliens](https://github.com/uplb-eliens).

# Platforms
I usually 'compete' in CodeChef's Week-long Challenge where try to solve one or two easy problems.
